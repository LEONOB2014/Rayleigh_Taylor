Rayleigh_Taylor
===============
This is an parallel implemention of compressible inviscid fluid solver
on Graphics Processing Units using NVIDIA's CUDA. 
Contributed by NYU graduate student:
Xiaoyi Xie, Yu Guo, Xinwei Li.

My friend, Doycho Karagyozov, nyu physics graduate student, also contributes to 
the sequential implementation of HLL Riemann Solver, and gives some quite useful
advice which help the accomplishment of this project. 

Also it's the final project for NYU Fall 12 Course--High Performance Computing.
